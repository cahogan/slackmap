# slackmap
A channel network visualization tool for Slack.

Despite the number of Slack integrations which pull outside data into Slack, very few exist to help with data analysis of your Slack environment. Slackmap fills this gap, providing a platform for generation of descriptive network graphs.

Filters:
- by recent activity
- by channel size
- by channel name (at this point, requires some environment-specific input)

Multiple filters can be displayed on the graph by attributing separate filter properties to the vertex fill color and the vertex halo.
Automatically uploads images into a desired Slack channel if desired.
